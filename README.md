# 2021-Updated-Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization

Assignments of 2021 updated Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

Coursera DeepLearning.AI updated its Deep Learning Specialization in 2021. This update has some new assigments and some new videos.

There is no Course 1 and 3, cause Course 1 has no new assigment and Course 3 has no assigment.

These are all from my own assigment.
