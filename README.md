# 2021 Updated Coursera Deep Learning Specialization Assignments

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) / [DeepLearning.AI](http://deeplearning.ai) have updated their **Deep Learning Specialization** in 2021.

This **update** contains some **new assignments** and some new videos.

So I put my own assignments here for record. And hope it could be helpful to those who are learning these courses❤.


**Note:** This repo has no Course 1 and 3, cause **Course 1 has no new assignment and Course 3 has no assignment.**
